"Vostok Blockchain Platform is a universal solution for a scalable "
"digital infrastructure that combines properties of public and private "
"blockchains for enterprise and state usage. The enterprise blockchain "
"platform solves the problem of trust between the parties not at the "
"level of business logic, but at the level of the platform operation "
"protocol. Supported PoS and PoA consensuses guarantee correctness of "
"data added to the blockchain, while decentralization provides "
"counterparty independence in terms of data access."
